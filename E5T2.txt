# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

Regula->for Terraform -configurations and compliance violations prior to deployment.

### Example vulnerability
Capturing the misconfigure items like policy to have access to all objects etc
Ex: 
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]


##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
AWS Inspector:
Mainly used for static scanning.
scurity assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications/Isntances

Other tools like clair, sysdig etc are available for dynamic scanning. 


### Example vulnerability
High
Today at 12:50 PM (GMT-7) (6 hours ago)
On instance i-0fe97a960cc855279, UDP port 23 which is associated with 'Telnet' is reachable from the internet
Assessment-Target-All-Instances -> Name:Web Service Instance - C3
Assessment-Template-Default
Network Reachability-1.1

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

AWS Config collects configuration snapshots of many of the core infrastructure services that AWS provides. When Config is enabled, you will have insight into how a particular resource is configured, when it changed, and what was changed.
The configuration snapshot serves as an input to rules which evaluate whether the configuration is in compliance or out of compliance with the conditions specified in the rule

### Example vulnerability
Checks whether HTTP to HTTPS redirection is configured on all HTTP listeners of Application Load Balancers. The rule is NON_COMPLIANT if one or more HTTP listeners of Application Load Balancers do not have HTTP to HTTPS redirection configured.
Checks whether the EBS volumes that are in an attached state are encrypted. If you specify the ID of a KMS key for encryption using the kmsId parameter, the rule checks if the EBS volumes in an attached state are encrypted with that KMS key.
