# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Add the Route 53 and  Cloud front -which will restrict user permsissions , provides both network and application level protection
Plan to Move the webinstance from public subnet to private subnet

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket
 An endpoint policy does not override or replace IAM user policies . So no.


# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No. Existing data will not get encrypted. only New data gets encrypted.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment
 we cannot apply the same cloud formation templates with same name. It will fail saying the stack already exisits. 
 if we rename the stack and then apply the cloud formation,all the changes we have done will be lost and it will go back to initial state.
