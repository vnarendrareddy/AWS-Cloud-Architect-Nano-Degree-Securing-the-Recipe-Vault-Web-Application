Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1) Security groups are not configured correctly. 
2) EC2 Volumes are not encrypted
3) Traffic is allowed from 0.0.0.0 i.e all ports are open.
4) Security on the webservice 


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Use Network ACL to restrict the traffic, Configure/update the security groups to restrict the traffic and not allow everything , remove the access from the internet for ports that needs to be secured like port 22 etc
